(a)	What do you want to talk about? Why talk about it? What is the best way to communicate your popular science content? Is it through short presentations, posters, some specific hands-on experiments, or something more creative? How will these activities be integrated into what existing curriculum? If the content of your science activities can be integrated into the curriculum, it will be more acceptable to schools and teachers. What risks should to be assessed and considered?

Explain the formation of chronic wounds and the progress of antibacterial dressings in recent years. Chronic wounds are often unable to effectively complete the normal wound healing process due to prolonged inflammation, antibiotic resistance, and the failure of skin cells to respond to repair signals, resulting in prolonged hemostasis or inflammation, leading to proliferation and remodeling failure. Among them, chronic inflammation and bacterial infection may be the two main factors leading to chronic and persistent wound healing. When a wound is infected with bacteria, Gram positive bacteria on the surface of the skin first enter the wound site. Next is the invasion of Gram-negative aerobic bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which reduce the oxygen content in the wound environment and promote the invasion of anaerobic bacteria. Bacteria release toxins and proteases, damaging the tissue and cells around the wound area. These toxins can also increase the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby prolonging the inflammatory phase, hindering cell migration, and preventing wound closure. In addition, bacteria can stick together and form biofilms, which can evade the invasion of antibiotics and the normal immune response of the skin, thereby protecting invading bacteria. Introduce the main antibacterial components of current antibacterial excipients, the shortcomings of antibiotics, and the importance of high-performance photothermal photodynamic antibacterial excipients in this study.

A brief report will be provided, and the research content and results will be made into posters to provide a more detailed introduction of one's work. Science popularization work can be combined with cell biology courses, as the research content involves many cytotoxicity and cell proliferation experiments; It can be combined with the course of biomaterials. Hydrogel wound dressing is a very important development direction in the field of wound dressing. Hydrogel matrix is an important matrix in the field of biomaterials. The 3D porous structure of hydrogel provides a carrier for functional molecules; Combining with the nanostructure course, this study focuses on MXene as the main antibacterial particle. The synthesis process of MXene and its nanostructure, as well as the transition behavior of photons by MXene nanoparticles under near-infrared light in photothermal experiments, have been studied in detail.

When introducing research work, two main safety risks should be noted:

1. Data security: This research involves a large amount of data, so data security is a risk that needs to be considered. This includes data encryption and backup, network security protection, and preventing data leakage.
  
2. Ethical risks: This research involves a large number of animal experiments, therefore ethical risks need to be considered. Mainly including compliance with ethical standards, welfare of experimental animals, etc.

(b)	Write a catchy title and an easy-to-understand introduction for your presentation

Titleï¼š Multifunctional MXene based high-performance antibacterial nanoparticle hydrogel.

Introduction:

The skin is the body's first line of defense against damage and microbial invasion, maintaining fluids, electrolytes and nutrients. However, it is also the most susceptible to environmental factors due to exposure to surfaces. After the skin structure is damaged, the healing of skin wounds will become an urgent problem. Chronic wounds are more susceptible to bacterial infections, which can lead to chronic skin inflammation. In general, antibiotic therapy is the preferred strategy to combat bacterial infections. However, due to the overuse of antibiotics, bacteria have developed resistance to many common antibiotics.

Phototherapy, especially photothermal therapy (PTT) and photo dynamics therapy (PDT), as a non-invasive way to treat bacterial infections, has become an effective strategy for the treatment of skin wound infection. Among them, photothermal agents (PTA) are particularly important. Ti3C2Tx (MXene) is considered a promising photothermal agent due to its high interface ratio, abundant surface functional groups and unique optical response characteristics, which can generate a large amount of heat under near-infrared irradiation. Moreover, MXene can directly interact with bacteria physically, and its sharp edges destroy bacterial cell membranes, resulting in the loss of bacterial membrane integrity. In addition, MXene has excellent biocompatibility and hydrophilicity, which has attracted more and more attention in the biomedical field. However, in practical applications, MXene, as a single semiconductor material, has a narrow absorption baseline, fast recombination efficiency of photogenerated carriers, low quantum yield, and unsatisfactory bacteriostatic effect. To solve this problem, this paper combines MXene with CuS nanoparticles to form a heterojunction structure. It can effectively promote the separation of carriers, further improving the photoconversion efficiency and antibacterial performance of MXene.
